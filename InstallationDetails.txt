2. Open Minecraft: Java Edition, with whichever launcher you use.
3. Go to "Options", "Resource Packs", then "Open Pack Folder"
4. A file browser window will appear.
5. Paste the 'ZPack' folder here.
6. Close the file browser window, and go back to Minecraft.
7. Press the arrow on 'ZPack' to enable the pack globally, or enable it per-world, if that's more your style.

8. Done!
