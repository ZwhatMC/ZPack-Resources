-- How to install ZPack Vanilla+ Resources (Pre-Release) --


The structure used in this resource pack will only work for Minecraft: Java Edition (1.21.5)
Installation may vary slightly, but usually, this is how it goes.

1. Cut the 'ZPack' file from your Downloads folder.
2. Open Minecraft: Java Edition, with whichever launcher you use.
3. Go to "Options", "Resource Packs", then "Open Pack Folder"
4. A file browser window will appear.
5. Paste the 'ZPack' folder in this window.
6. Close the file browser window, and go back to Minecraft.
7. Press the right arrow on 'ZPack' to enable the pack globally, or enable it per-world, if that's more your style.

8. Done!
